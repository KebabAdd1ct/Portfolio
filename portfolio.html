      <p>
        I'm Ibrahim Bati. Eighteen years old. A software developer born and raised in the Netherlands. 
        I started learning software developing in late 2022 when I entered college to study software developing. 
        My dream is to be able to dish the solutions that are needed by those whom have problems with ease and have
        those solutions be perfection. In order to achieve it I'm on my journey learning new skills and bits of 
        knowledge everyday. I'm getting closer to perfection day by day and no one is getting as close to it as I am. 
        Do you wish for perfection and are in need of a software developer? Then I'm the one you need.
      </p>
      <div id="cv" class="section">CV</div>
      <p>
        Every one of my skills and useful abilities are to be listed here somewhere in the near future as the website
        isn't even near completion. Once it is you'll see the knowledge, skill and mastery that I am in posession of
        in the field of software developing.
      </p>
      <div id="projects" class="section">Projects</div>
      <p>
        The projects I have made and that are visible are usually the ones I make as part of a school assignment.
        The ones that are made by myself with the intention of gaining the ability and skill of making such a
        project will be marked as a project made by myself. You'll be able to see my progress through each of
        my projects and see the skill that I am in posession of. Hopefully they will aswell open your eyes to
        the things you can achieve with me as the software developer you need.
